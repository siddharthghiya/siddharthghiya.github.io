I recently graduated from the Masters in Mechanical Engineering (Research) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I was a Graduate Assistant at the Advanced Agent Robotics Technology Lab, and was advised by Prof. Katia Sycara. I am broadly interested in the application to deep reinforcment learning algorithms to multi-agent syatems. I have also taken courses and have done projets in the areas of path planning and controls. Before coming to CMU, I did my undergraduate studies at Thapar University, India.
