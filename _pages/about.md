Hi, I am Siddharth! I am currently working as a Machine Learning Research Scientist at Cognitiv.ai.

I completed my Master's in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2020. During my Master's, I worked with Dr. Katia Sycara at the Advanced Agent Robotics Lab. While at CMU, the focus of my research was on the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms to multi-agent systems. Before my Master's at CMU, I completed my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering from Thapar University, Patiala, India.

My research interests are in the fields of multi-agent systems, deep reinforcement learning, deep learning, machine learning, and path planning.
