* In this project, we implement a novel neural network architecture called Cascading Convolutional Neural Network. The topology of the network is not determined at the start. Hidden units are added as the training progresses. We augmented the CASCOR with convlutional hidden units.
* In our experiments, we obtained an accuracy of 91 percent over MNIST dataset and 89 percent over CIFAR-10 dataset.
